ColorRing CC (Command Center)
=============================

2 Adafruit NeoPixel LED strips, connected to Arduino board, controlled from a web browser, over Wi-Fi.

Use the web browser to create & send commands to the LED strips, as well as send real-time color data to the LED strips.

This code runs on the local web server. You also need the code which runs on the Arduino board: https://github.com/briggsm/colorring
